# my really cool dotfiles
originally stolen from [Awesome-copycats](https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats)

decided not to make it from scratch so i edited copland i swear i changed it up

installation guide:

dependencies (assuming you're using arch):
```awesome-git alsa-utils mpd nerd-fonts-complete rofi kitty``` thats it i think

then drag the folders and files you want into your ~/.config

for the awesome config to work rename secret.lua.example to secret.lua and change the variables inside it

done 

its uncanny how easy it is
